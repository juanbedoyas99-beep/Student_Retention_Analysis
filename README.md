# 🎓 Higher Education Student Retention Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains an exploratory and statistical analysis of factors influencing **student retention, dropout, and graduation outcomes** in higher education institutions.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle:
👉 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention

The objective of this project is to analyze demographic, academic, and financial variables to identify patterns associated with student dropout and successful graduation.

This repository focuses on structured data exploration and visual analytics to better understand predictors of student performance and retention.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and includes student-level information related to enrollment characteristics, academic performance, financial status, and final outcomes (Dropout, Enrolled, Graduate).

2. **Data Cleaning & Structuring**  
   - Handling missing or inconsistent values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Structuring outcome labels (Target variable)  
   - Creating grouped metrics (age, gender, tuition status, etc.)

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of dropout by age at enrollment  
   - Gender-based outcome comparison  
   - Tuition payment status vs. dropout risk  
   - Geographic distribution (where applicable)  
   - Outcome proportion analysis (Dropout vs Graduate vs Enrolled)

4. **Visualization**  
   Multiple graphical representations were generated, including:
   - Histograms  
   - Pie charts  
   - Box plots  
   - Geographic maps  
   - Comparative categorical charts  

   These visualizations help identify structural differences between students who graduate and those who drop out.

## 📈 Key Objectives

- Identify demographic patterns associated with dropout  
- Evaluate financial factors influencing retention  
- Compare graduation vs dropout distributions  
- Detect risk indicators for early intervention  
- Provide structured datasets for predictive modeling and machine learning applications
